TOP(1)                    User Commands                    TOP(1)



<B>NAME
     </B>top - display and  update  information  about  the  top  cpu
     processes

<B>SYNOPSIS
     top </B>[ -<B>SbiInquv </B>] [ -<B>d</B><I>count </I>] [  -<B>s</B><I>time  </I>]  [  -<B>o</B><I>field  </I>]  [
     -<B>U</B><I>username </I>] [ <I>number </I>]


<B>DESCRIPTION
     </B><I>Top </I>displays the top 15 processes on the system and periodi-
     cally  updates this information.  Raw cpu percentage is used
     to rank the processes.  If <I>number </I>is  given,  then  the  top
     <I>number </I>processes will be displayed instead of the default.

     <I>Top </I>makes  a  distinction  between  terminals  that  support
     advanced  capabilities and those that do not.  This distinc-
     tion affects the choice of defaults for certain options.  In
     the remainder of this document, an "intelligent" terminal is
     one that supports cursor addressing, clear screen, and clear
     to  end  of line.  Conversely, a "dumb" terminal is one that
     does not support such features.  If the  output  of  <I>top  </I>is
     redirected  to  a file, it acts as if it were being run on a
     dumb terminal.

<B>OPTIONS
     </B>-<B>S   </B>Show system processes in the display.  Normally, system
          processes  such  as  the  pager and the swapper are not
          shown.  This option makes them visible.

     -<B>b   </B>Use "batch" mode.  In this mode,  all  input  from  the
          terminal  is ignored.  Interrupt characters (such as ^C
          and ^\) still have an effect.  This is the default on a
          dumb terminal, or when the output is not a terminal.

     -<B>i   </B>Use "interactive" mode.  In this  mode,  any  input  is
          immediately  read  for  processing.  See the section on
          "Interactive Mode" for an  explanation  of  which  keys
          perform  what  functions.   After  the  command is pro-
          cessed, the screen will immediately be updated, even if
          the  command  was  not  understood.   This  mode is the
          default when standard output is an  intelligent  termi-
          nal.

     -<B>I   </B>Do  not  display  idle  processes.   By  default,   top
          displays both active and idle processes.

     -<B>n   </B>Use "non-interactive"  mode.   This  is  indentical  to
          "batch" mode.

     -<B>q   </B>Renice <I>top </I>to -20 so that it will run faster.  This can
          be  used  when  the  system  is  being very sluggish to
          improve the possibility  of  discovering  the  problem.
          This option can only be used by root.

     -<B>u   </B>Do not take the time to map uid numbers  to  usernames.
          Normally,   <I>top   </I>will   read   as  much  of  the  file
          "/etc/passwd" as is necessary to map all  the  user  id
          numbers  it  encounters  into login names.  This option
          disables all that, while possibly decreasing  execution
          time.   The  uid  numbers  are displayed instead of the
          names.

     -<B>v   </B>Write version number information to  stderr  then  exit
          immediately.  No other processing takes place when this
          option is used.  To see  current  revision  information
          while top is running, use the help command "?".

     -<B>d</B><I>count
          </I>Show only <I>count </I>displays, then exit.  A display is con-
          sidered  to  be  one update of the screen.  This option
          allows the user to select the  number  of  displays  he
          wants  to  see  before  <I>top  </I>automatically  exits.  For
          intelligent terminals, no  upper  limit  is  set.   The
          default is 1 for dumb terminals.

     -<B>s</B><I>time
          </I>Set the delay between screen updates to  <I>time  </I>seconds.
          The default delay between updates is 5 seconds.

     -<B>o</B><I>field
          </I>Sort the process display area on the  specified  field.
          The field name is the name of the column as seen in the
          output, but in lower case.  Likely  values  are  "cpu",
          "size",  "res",  and  "time", but may vary on different
          operating systems.  Note that not all operating systems
          support this option.

     -<B>U</B><I>username
          </I>Show only those  processes  owned  by  <I>username</I>.   This
          option  currently  only  accepts usernames and will not
          understand uid numbers.

     Both <I>count </I>and <I>number </I>fields can be specified as "infinite",
     indicating  that  they can stretch as far as possible.  This
     is accomplished by using any proper prefix of  the  keywords
     "infinity",  "maximum",  or "all".  The default for <I>count </I>on
     an intelligent terminal is, in fact, <B>infinity</B>.

     The environment variable <B>TOP </B>is examined for options  before
     the command line is scanned.  This enables a user to set his
     or her own defaults.  The number of processes to display can
     also  be  specified  in  the  environment variable <B>TOP</B>.  The
     options -<B>I</B>, -<B>S</B>, and  -<B>u  </B>are  actually  toggles.   A  second
     specification of any of these options will negate the first.
     Thus a user who has the environment variable <B>TOP </B>set to "-I"
     may use the command "top -I" to see idle processes.


<B>INTERACTIVE MODE
     </B>When <I>top </I>is running in "interactive mode", it reads commands
     from  the  terminal and acts upon them accordingly.  In this
     mode, the terminal is put in "CBREAK", so that  a  character
     will  be processed as soon as it is typed.  Almost always, a
     key will be pressed when <I>top </I>is between displays;  that  is,
     while  it is waiting for <I>time </I>seconds to elapse.  If this is
     the case, the command will be processed and the display will
     be  updated  immediately  thereafter (reflecting any changes
     that the command may have specified).  This happens even  if
     the command was incorrect.  If a key is pressed while <I>top </I>is
     in the middle of updating the display, it  will  finish  the
     update  and then process the command.  Some commands require
     additional  information,  and  the  user  will  be  prompted
     accordingly.   While  typing this information in, the user's
     erase and kill keys (as set up  by  the  command  <I>stty</I>)  are
     recognized, and a newline terminates the input.

     These  commands  are  currently  recognized  (^L  refers  to
     control-L):

     <B>^L   </B>Redraw the screen.

     <B>h </B>or <B>?
          </B>Display a summary of the commands (help screen).   Ver-
          sion information is included in this display.

     <B>q    </B>Quit <I>top</I>.

     <B>d    </B>Change the number of displays to show (prompt  for  new
          number).  Remember that the next display counts as one,
          so typing <B>d1 </B>will make <I>top </I>show one final  display  and
          then immediately exit.

     <B>n or #
          </B>Change the number of processes to display  (prompt  for
          new number).

     <B>s    </B>Change the number of seconds to delay between  displays
          (prompt for new number).

     <B>k    </B>Send  a  signal  ("kill"  by  default)  to  a  list  of
          processes.    This   acts   similarly  to  the  command
          <I>kill</I>(1)).

     <B>r    </B>Change  the  priority  (the  "nice")  of  a   list   of
          processes.   This  acts  similarly  to the command <I>ren-
          ice</I>(8)).

     <B>u    </B>Display only processes owned  by  a  specific  username
          (prompt  for  username).   If the username specified is
          simply "+", then processes belonging to all users  will
          be displayed.

     <B>o    </B>Change the order in which the display is sorted.   This
          command  is not available on all systems.  The sort key
          names vary fron system to system but  usually  include:
          "cpu", "res", "size", "time".  The default is cpu.

     <B>e    </B>Display a list of system errors (if any)  generated  by
          the last <B>k</B>ill or <B>r</B>enice command.

     <B>i    </B>(or <B>I) </B>Toggle the display of idle processes.


<B>THE DISPLAY
     </B>The actual display varies depending on the specific  variant
     of  Unix  that the machine is running.  This description may
     not exactly match what is seen by top running on  this  par-
     ticular  machine.  Differences are listed at the end of this
     manual entry.

     The top few lines of the display  show  general  information
     about the state of the system, including the last process id
     assigned to a process (on  most  systems),  the  three  load
     averages,   the   current   time,  the  number  of  existing
     processes, the number of processes in each state  (sleeping,
     running,  starting,  zombies, and stopped), and a percentage
     of time spent in each of the processor states  (user,  nice,
     system,  and idle).  It also includes information about phy-
     sial and virtual memory allocation.

     The remainder of the screen displays information about indi-
     vidual  processes.   This  display  is  similar in spirit to
     <I>ps</I>(1) but it is not exactly the same.  PID  is  the  process
     id,  USERNAME  is  the name of the process's owner (if -<B>u </B>is
     specified, a UID column will be substituted  for  USERNAME),
     PRI is the current priority of the process, NICE is the nice
     amount (in the range -20 to 20), SIZE is the total  size  of
     the  process  (text,  data,  and  stack), RES is the current
     amount of resident memory (both SIZE and RES  are  given  in
     kilobytes),  STATE  is  the  current  state (one of "sleep",
     "WAIT", "run", "idl", "zomb", or "stop"), TIME is the number
     of  system  and  user cpu seconds that the process has used,
     WCPU, when displayed, is the weighted cpu  percentage  (this
     is  the  same  value that <I>ps</I>(1) displays as CPU), CPU is the
     raw percentage and is the field that is sorted to  determine
     the  order  of the processes, and COMMAND is the name of the
     command that the process is currently running (if  the  pro-
     cess is swapped out, this column is marked "<swapped>").

<B>NOTES
     </B>The "ABANDONED" state (known in the kernel as  "SWAIT")  was
     abandoned,  thus the name.  A process should never end up in
     this state.

<B>BUGS
     </B>Don't shoot me, but the default  for  -<B>I  </B>has  changed  once
     again.   So  many  people were confused by the fact that <I>top
     </I>wasn't showing them all the processes that I have decided to
     make  the default behavior show idle processes, just like it
     did in version 2.  But to appease folks who can't stand that
     behavior,  I have added the ability to set "default" options
     in the environment variable <B>TOP </B>(see the  OPTIONS  section).
     Those  who  want the behavior that version 3.0 had need only
     set the environment variable <B>TOP </B>to "-I".

     The command name for swapped  processes  should  be  tracked
     down, but this would make the program run slower.

     As with <I>ps</I>(1), things can change  while  <I>top  </I>is  collecting
     information  for  an update.  The picture it gives is only a
     close approximation to reality.
